My research interests are broad and varied, I am most passionate about the nexus of climate and the cryosphere, particularly relating to water resources. I am most interested in collecting quality observational data to better inform and validate geodetic data to examine large-scale glacier change, and to use direct observations and remote sensing to calibrate and validate local- to regional- scale physical models of glacier evolution. These topics are outlined here:

### Glaciological and geodetic mass balance
