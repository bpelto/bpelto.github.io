I am a PhD student at the University of Northern British Columbia Department of Geography [investigating glacier mass change](https://www.unbc.ca/newsroom/unbc-stories/unbc-phd-candidate-measures-glacier-mass-change-columbia-river-basin) in the Columbia and Rocky Mountains of British Columbia. My project focuses on further our ability to measure and understand the response of glaciers to climate change. To do so, I collected [field-based and remotely-sensed data](https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/13/1709/2019/) over a five-year period for glaciers in the upper Columbia River basin. I use these data to quantify glacier change over this period. More importantly, however, I use these data to develop methods to systematically measure mass balance at seasonal to annual time scales for many hundreds of glaciers within a given mountain range.

My passion is studying the nexus between climate and the cryosphere, particularly from a water resources perspective. My work at UNBC is part of the Canadian Columbia River Basin Snow and Glacier Research Network. After our five-year study we have a [technical report](https://ourtrust.org/new-research-available-columbia-basin-glaciers/) on the state of glaciers, snowpack, climate and hydrology relating to the cryosphere in the upper Columbia River Basin. I am also a [Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions](https://pics.uvic.ca/research/thinning-ice) (PICS) Fellow.

My masters degree (MSc in Geoscience), from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, focused on paleoceanography in the Bering and Chukchi Seas, studying the flooding of the Bering Strait and connection of the Pacific and Arctic Oceans. I studied under the direction of Dr. Julie Brigham-Grette. My master's [thesis](https://scholarworks.umass.edu/masters_theses_2/108/) focused on cores from the Bering and Chukchi Seas from 27,000 to 2,000 years before present. The Bering Sea half of my thesis was published in [Paleoceanography](https://doi.org/10.1002/2017PA003265).

Prior to attending UMass Amherst, I graduated from Alfred University in 2012 with a B.A. in Geology and Environmental Studies.
