I am a PhD student at the University of Northern British Columbia Department of Geography [investigating glacier mass change](https://www.unbc.ca/newsroom/unbc-stories/unbc-phd-candidate-measures-glacier-mass-change-columbia-river-basin) in the Columbia and Rocky Mountains of British Columbia. My project focuses on further our ability to measure and understand the response of glaciers to climate change. To do so, I collected field-based and remotely-sensed data over a five-year period for glaciers in the upper Columbia River basin. I use these data to quantify glacier change over this period. More importantly, however, I use these data to develop methods to systematically measure mass balance at seasonal to annual time scales for many hundreds of glaciers within a given mountain range.


I have a MSc in Geoscience from the University of Massachusetts Amherst where I studying paleoceanography under the direction of Dr. Julie Brigham-Grette.
My master's [thesis](https://scholarworks.umass.edu/masters_theses_2/108/) focused on cores from the Bering and Chukchi Seas from 27,000 to 2,000 years before present. The Bering Sea half of my thesis was published in [Paleoceanography](https://doi.org/10.1002/2017PA003265).

Prior to attending UMass Amherst, I graduated from Alfred University in 2012 with a B.A. in Geology and Environmental Studies.
