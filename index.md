I am a PhD student at the University of Northern British Columbia [Department of Atmospheric and Cryospheric Sciences](http://acinn.uibk.ac.at/).


I have a MSc in Geoscience from the University of Massachusetts Amherst where I studying paleoceanography under the direction of Dr. Julie Brigham-Grette.
My master's thesis focused on cores from the Bering and Chukchi Seas from 27,000 to 2,000 years before present. My thesis can be found [here](http://www.klima.tu-berlin.de/index.php?show=home_start&lan=en/), and the Bering Sea half of my thesis was published [here](http://www.isae.fr/en) in Paleoceanography.

Prior to attending UMass Amherst, I graduated from Alfred University in 2012 with a B.A. in Geology and Environmental Studies.
