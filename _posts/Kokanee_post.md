KOKANEE GLACIER PROVINCIAL PARK (est 1922), 320.35 sq km, is one of BC's oldest parks. It is located in the SELKIRK MTS north of NELSON, west of KOOTENAY LK. The area was well picked over by prospectors in the late 19th century and several lead, SILVER and ZINC mines were formerly in production (see MINING). The terrain features high granitic peaks intersected by several deep valleys. There are 3 glaciers—Kokanee, Caribou and Woodbury—feeding many LAKES and creeks. The park contains prime grizzly BEAR habitat.
