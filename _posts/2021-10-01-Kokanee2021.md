excerpt: "2021 alone wasted away 6% of the glacier's total volume --- an eye-watering number for a single year"

Since 2013 I have been working on the Kokanee Glacier. Located just outside of Nelson in southeastern British Columbia (BC), the Kokanee Glacier is due north of the Washington-Idaho border. This work began as part of a five-year study of the cryosphere in the Canadian portion of the Columbia River. This project was carried out by the Canadian Columbia River Snow and Glacier Research Network -- spearheaded by the <a href="https://ourtrust.org/">Columbia Basin Trust</a>. The glacier research, which included the Kokanee Glacier, was led by my former PhD supervisor at the University of Northern British Columbia Dr. Brian Menounos and myself. At the culmination of the project, we published a <a href="https://ourtrust.org/?ddownload=19532">technical report</a>, and a <a href="https://ourtrust.org/?ddownload=18066">plain language summary</a> of that report. When the five-year project officially ended in 2018, I learned of a BC Parks program called Living Labs, which offers funding for climate change research in BC Parks, particularly research which documents change and guides protected area management. With Living Labs funding in 2019-2021, I have kept the annual mass balance trips going -- now a continuous nine-year record -- and a winter mass balance trip in 2021. In conjunction with this, Brian Menounos has secured continued funding (continued from our 5-year project) from BC Hydro for LiDAR surveys of the glacier every spring and fall. These surveys are carried out by the Airborne Coastal Observatory team from the <a href="https://www.hakai.org/">Hakai Institute</a>.
