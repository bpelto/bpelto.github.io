### Geomorphology 210

I taught two 20-student 3-hour lab sections of Geomorphology 210 as a lab instructor. I greatly enjoyed the experience, but did not work as a TA again at UNBC due to field work demands of the [CCRBSGRN](https://ourtrust.org/new-research-available-columbia-basin-glaciers/) and the data-intensive nature of my PhD.

I have also given a number of guest lectures:
- 2021, Arctic and Alpine Environments GE397, _Glacier Mass Balance and Glacier Runoff_, Colby College, Maine

- 2021, Snow and Ice 454, _Glacier mass balance_, UNBC [Lecture slides](/teaching/glacier_mass_balance_snow_and_ice_lecture2021.pdf)

- 2020  Snow and Ice 454, _Glacier mass balance_, UNBC 

- 2019	Earth Science Careers 212, _A studentâ€™s perspective on Physical Geography Degree and research opportunities_, UNBC 

- 2018	Quaternary and Surficial Geology 411, _Oceanographic and climatic change in the Bering Sea, Last Glacial Maximum to Holocene_, UNBC 

- 2018 	Climate Science Informal Seminar, _Seasonal glacier mass balance from airborne laser altimetry, Columbia River Basin, Canada_, UNBC 

- 2018	Snow and Ice 454, _Introduction to Glaciers_, UNBC 

- 2017 	Quaternary and Surficial Geology 411, _Glacier mass change detection methods_, UNBC 

- 2017 	Snow and Ice 454, _Introduction to Glaciers_, UNBC 

- 2014 	Geomorphology 210 Lecture: _Introduction to Paleoclimatology, Bering and Chukchi Sea Case Study_, UNBC
