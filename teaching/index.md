### Geomorphology 210

I taught two 20-student 3-hour lab sections of Geomorphology 210 as a lab instructor. I greatly enjoyed the experience, but did not work as a TA again at UNBC due to field work demands as a part of the [CCRBSGRN](https://ourtrust.org/new-research-available-columbia-basin-glaciers/) and the data-intensive nature of my PhD.

I did however give a number of guest lectures:

- Snow and Ice 454, Glacier mass balance [Lecture slides](/teaching/glacier_mass_balance_snow_and_ice_lecture.pdf)
