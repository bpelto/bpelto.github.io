### Geomorphology 210

I taught two 20-student 3-hour lab sections of Geomorphology 210 as a lab instructor. I greatly enjoyed the experience, but did not work as a TA again at UNBC due to field work demands as a part of the [CCRBSGRN](https://ourtrust.org/new-research-available-columbia-basin-glaciers/) and the data-intensive nature of my PhD.

I did however give a number of guest lectures:

- 2021, Snow and Ice 454, Glacier mass balance [Lecture slides](/teaching/glacier_mass_balance_snow_and_ice_lecture2021.pdf)

- 2020    Snow and Ice 454, Glacier mass balance, UNBC 

- 2019	Earth Science Careers 212, A studentâ€™s perspective on Physical Geography Degree and research opportunities, UNBC 

- 2018	Quaternary and Surficial Geology 411, Oceanographic and climatic change in the Bering Sea, Last Glacial Maximum to Holocene, UNBC 

- 2018 	Climate Science Informal Seminar, Seasonal glacier mass balance from airborne laser  

altimetry, Columbia River Basin, Canada, UNBC 

- 2018	Snow and Ice 454, Introduction to Glaciers 

- 2017 	Quaternary and Surficial Geology 411, Glacier mass change detection methods, UNBC 

- 2017 	Snow and Ice 454, Introduction to Glaciers, UNBC 

- 2014 	Geomorphology 210 Lecture: Introduction to Paleoclimatology, Bering and Chukchi Sea Case Study, UNBC
