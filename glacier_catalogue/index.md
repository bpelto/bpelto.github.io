This is my catalogue of every glacier I have visited, both for work and leisure! I have grouped them by country and province. For now this is one giant list of pictures and names, I hope to make separate pages for many of these glaciers eventually. Perhaps expanding to glaciers I have photographed but not been on.

## Canada

## British Columbia

- Bridge Glacier: My study site during my postdoc at UBC with Dan Moore, the Bridge Glacier, a 75 km<sup>2</sup> lake-terminating valley glacier in the southern Coast Mountains of BC.

    <figcaption> The terminus of the Bridge Glacier in July 2021. The glacier is still actively calving, but is nearing the end of the lake, and will soon likely be a land-terminating glacier.  </figcaption>

### Garibaldi Ne&eacute;ve&eacute; Traverse Glaciers

On the Garibaldi Ne&eacute;ve&eacute; Traverse, I crossed five glaciers, the Garibaldi, Bishop, North Pitt, Warren, and Sentinel glaciers.

- Garibaldi Glacier
- Bishop Glacier 
- North Pitt Glacier
- Warren Glacier
- Sentinel Glacier

    <figcaption> Mount Garibaldi (2675 m, 8776 ft) looms at center right as sharp rocky peak, with "The Tent" to the right, and Dalton at center, and Atwell Peak to the left. We are skiing across the lobe of the Garibadli and Bishop glaciers. The ice falls above feed the Garibaldi Glacier, but the prominent rock band indicates that the glacier is in the process of detaching, only serac fall can feed the main lobe at center, with a thin connection seen below The Tent.   </figcaption>

    <figcaption> After crossing the Garibaldi and Bishop glaciers and ascending to 2170 m, we cross the North Pitt Glacier, first by descending to 2000 m avoid crevasses. Here Fran&ccedil;ois has lost speed and needs to walk a bit before another descent. A party heading south, opposite our direction of travel, is below our track.   </figcaption>

    <figcaption> We next have a short fun 100 m descent below the Sharkfin, crossing the NW corner of the Warren Glacier for 2 km. </figcaption>

    </a>
    <figcaption> Our final glacier crossing is the small western part of the Sentinel Glaicier. This arm formerly connected to the main body of the glacier but separated around 2005. The glacier covers about 100 m of the 425 m descent to Garbaldi Lake. Below the glacier, we pass the old Sentinel Bay Glaciology hut, still used by intrepid skiiers. </figcaption>
